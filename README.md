It is ofical the botnet is open source :D

here is a list of all the options:

it supports a 1000 users, shell acces to the infected computer, information giving about the infected computer like ( external ip, hostname, operating system and administrator or not when your on windows ), keepalive check, screenshot, downloaden and uploaden.

things that are partitional completed are: selfdestruct the virus.

the backdoor isn't seen by any viruscaner ( checked on date 11/3/2017 ).
the botnet is written in java with netbeans.

things that i didn't add are Ddos or raandsomeware.

options that i am working on are: vnc, webcam snapshot, a keylogger, Persistence backdoor, network scan likely with nmap, passwords and cookie grap ( also skype ), video on full screen that cant be closed, mimikatz, Distributed hash cracking, microfone spying, popup for credentials, script mining.

there is a option thats enabled is sponsormode that will if enabled mine for the creator but it can easly be dissabled by going in the server and change the varible sponsormode from true to false.

this are the wworking options:
list info : that will give you a detailed list of all the computers in the botnet and thee hostname, external ip, operating system, adn if on windows if it had administrator rights.
msgbox : this will give a msgbox on the targets computer.
